observation:
->we have find gcd(A,M)==gcd(A+X,M) where X[0......M-1]
->so gcd(A+X,M)=g where g is gcd(A,M)
->here Y=A+X so gcd(Y,M)=g divide the equation by g
->gcd(Y/g,M/g)=1 we have find all the relative prime to (M/g)
-> we know euler  phi(M/g) is number of relative prime 
->and that will be our answer
 phi(X)= product of all primes p divides X
       =product of(1-(1/p)) where p is all prime that divides X

Implementation:
->sieve all primes up 10^5
->and find euler phi function of (M/g) by using formula
->that will our answer
