Observation:
->there is N round and 2^N players
->each round 2 adjacent player will played and higher rating player will be will
-> after (N-1) rounds there will be final 
->we have print who will lose in the final match and index of that player
->if we observe we can divide the players in two groups , first group will be[0.....N/2] and [N/2......N]
->so final will be played by winner of the first group and winner of second group
->answer will be minimum of them 

Implementation:
->traverse the array until n/2 for first group and find maximum for the winner and same for the second group
->minimum of them will be our answer
->In map we store the index of all players
