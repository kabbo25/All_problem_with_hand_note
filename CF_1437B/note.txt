Problem statement:
->given a even length string with equal number of zero's and one's 
->we can reverse any substring of s
->so that we can make this alternating
or there will be consecutive two zero's or one's
->we have to find minimum number of swaps

Observation:
->first we have swap that substring which starting element and ending element will be different otherwise swap will be not beneficial
->and swap actually means that
if length of substring is n then 
we actuall swap change(n/2) elements 
and if n is odd then(n/2) element will be unchanged
->key observation is no matter what substring we reverse maximum we can change one pair 
like if string is [11110000]->[10001110]->before operation there is 3 one's pair but now after one operation there is 2 pair which have adjacent one's
after second operation it will become [10101110] now we have only 1 pair which have adjacent one 
->formally we can say that we have n consetive same characters we need (n-1)swap
which is actually nothing but number of pairs


Implementation:
->we actually count the adjacent pair's of consecutive one's and zero's 
->answer will be maximum of (pair of zero's and pair of one's)
