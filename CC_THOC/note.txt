Observation:
->we have given a array we have choose  two continuos segment 
so that their sum will be maximum
->more formally we have choose
two indices i and j where 
where i indicates that maximum continuos sum we get till i from first index and  j indicate maximum continuos sum from j to N

->we actually we have find maximum
prefix continuos sum which end at i and maximum suffix continuos sum which starts from  j till N

->all all indices i[1.....N-1]
we take prefix sum(i) +suffix sum (i+1)
and take maximum of it


Implementation:
->precompute prefix  sum and suffix sum using kadane's algorithm
->traverse through all i and take sum of prefix + suffix sum
->maximum of among them will be our answer
