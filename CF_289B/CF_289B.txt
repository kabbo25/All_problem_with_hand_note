observation:
-> first of all we can change by d 
->make every element equal to same in minimum number of operations
-> example:
2 2 2
2 4
6 8
->finding median and check the difference ,if difference is multiple of d then we can make it,other wise not.
Implementation:
first of all sort the array then finding the median ,then find the absolute difference and divide it by k
