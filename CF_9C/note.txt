Observation:
-> we have count all the numbers have digit 0 or 1 less than equal N
->example:if N is 11
then 1,10,11 these 3 numbers have only digit 0 or 1 so answer will be 3
->so if N is 534 then we have _ _ _ 3 digit place 
-> we will try all possible combination by placing 0 and 1 every postion 
->and generate a number if number is less than N then count will increase by 1

Implementation:
->we will start dfs by 1 until 1e9
->we will shift digit place by  multiply the number by 10
->like if number is 10 multiply 10 it will become 100 we shift the number from 2 digit to three digit 
->another dfs will add 1 to digit place 
->that's how we will generate all possible number which containing only 1 or 0
