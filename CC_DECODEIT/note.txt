Observe:
->there is 4 bits numbers[2^4-1]decimal numbers 
so we have [0.......15] and each number assigned to a character [a.....p]
example:a->1,b->2,c->3........p->15
->Now for a given binary string we have to decode that string

example:00001111 here first four character is (0000) which equal 0 and equivalent character is a 
->next four character is(1111) equivalent character is p
so final string will be ap


Implementation:
->map character with number
->take four digit binary and convert it to decimal and print equivalent decimal character of that number

and final string will be our answer
