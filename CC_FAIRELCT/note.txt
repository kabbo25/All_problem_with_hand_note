Observe:
->there is two candidates in final election
->one person can vote one candidate
->for every candidate there is N packs and every packs has Ai amount of votes

->In one step we can swap candidate votes so that candidate one can win
->we have print minimum numbers of swap needed

->we can sort both candidate vote array
->take the minimum amount of vote and swap with maximum number of vote of second candidate

->repeat the process until the candidate one win  or print -1

Implementation:
->sort the both array one increasingly and one decreasingly 
->use prefix sum to calculate total votes and when swap values 
we subtract a[i] from prefix sum and add b[i] to it 
->repeat this process until one candidate win
->or print -1
