Observation:
->there is N problem setters and each one can create Ai problems
->To organize one div3 contest we need K problems

->sum of all Ai will be our total problems

->number of div3 contest we can organize is (sum/k)

->but we can do maximum D constest 
->if we have problem so we can organize more than D contest ,then answer will D 
Implementation:
->sum will be sum of all array elements 
->ans will sum/k
->ans will be minimum of( ans,D)
