Observation:
->there will be one string consisting of ("(" ,")","[","]");
->In one move we can remove one right bracket sequence greedily 
-> we perform this move  till string have (RBS) bracket sequence 
->maximum number of move we can play will be our answer

->we can observe that if ("(") occurs before (")")we can remove it
Implementation:
->first we solve for first bracket and then for second bracket
->if first bracket occurs we increase the cnt and if left bracket occurs we will decrease cnt and increase the answer
->but we have to take care of that thing is that is (cnt<=0) and left bracket occur we don't icrease the answer because that will break above condition
