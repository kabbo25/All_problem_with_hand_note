Observation:
->given N task with given range and we have to pay in these days
-> we have two payement method either pay C yen per day
->or pay for individual task with cost of C0,C1......CN
-> Now we have greedily choose between payment method 1 or 2 which minimum for that day
-> and total cost will be our answer

Implementation:
->we will use prefix sum to calculate sum of all individual task cost in ith day 
->traverse through all days in given range and 
take the minimum of payment method 1 or 2 
and add to sum
->sum will be answer which is minimum
