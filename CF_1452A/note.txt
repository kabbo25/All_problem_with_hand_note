Observation:
-> A robot can move in any four direction in one step  in 2d plane or stay in that cell
->But he can't move in the same direction more than once
->we have to find minimum number of steps to reach from (0,0)->(x,y)
->the key idea here is  we move one step in x direction and one step in y direction 
->if we ran out of any direction then we will take two step to move in that direction so that we don't have to perform same operation twice

example: if x=3, and y=5
->first move in x direction then in y so on ... we reach (3,3) in 6 alternative steps  but there are remaining  2 y direction, we move first up then stay then again up 
->so need 3 steps more and  so total step will be (6+3)==9
->so if we have n steps left then we have to stay (n-1) stay so that no moves occur twice

Implementation:
->first ans=min(x,y) in these steps we move alternatively
->then rem=|x-y| 
->we add rem and rem-1 steps 
->sum of all steps will be our answer
