Observation:
->given a string we have to find maximum distance between two characters where both characters are distinct

Implementation:
->we use binary search to find that answer in range[1........N] 
-> we chk if mid length is possible or not 
->if possible then we search for more bigger length by using low=mid+1
if not possible high=mid-1

->chk function will be implement by sliding window method 
if ith character is s[i] then s[i+mid] is distinct then return true or false
