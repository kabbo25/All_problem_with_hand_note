observation:
->i have to delete all adjacent elements
->count all the adjacent numbers
->if count[a.....z] is even delete all
->else add one character of this
example:abbbaa
first count of [a] is 1 so add it
      count of [b] is 3 add one b
      count of [a] is 2 add nothing
   so new string will be ab
and that is our answer

Implementation:
->traverse the string and  count all occurance
->until we reach all adjacent unique elements
->we run one infinite while loop and flag
->flag will be true if there is no adjacent element and break the loop and 
print the answer
