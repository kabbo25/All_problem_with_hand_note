Problem statement:
->There is a building which consists 
three apartments with size 3,5,7 and each apartement has one window
->Monocarp see the building from outside and count n windows
->we have to print a possbile configaration of building so that it satisfy the condition of n windows
->other wise we have print -1
Observation:
->we can write this mathmatically and we have to find the solution
3x+5y+7z=n and we have find the value of x,y,z and if we don't find any such solutions then we print -1
if we set y and z equal 0 then our equal look like this
3x=n where x=(n/3) so n can be big as (1000/3) =333 which is max value of 3 this way we can see 
max value y is (1000/5)=200 and 
but we don't need the third value coz 
for this formula 
 7z = (n - (3 * i + 5 * j));
 so z=(n-(3*i+5*j))/7
 so it have to divisible by 7 or there is no answer 


Implementation:
->we will run three nested loops 
of and try all possible combination of x,y

->if we won't find any such combination  we will print -1
